def answering_machine(message, caller_name):
    """Simulates an answering machine by returning a message string."""
    return f"Hi, this is {caller_name}. {message}. Please leave a message after the beep."
This function takes two parameters: message and caller_name. The message parameter represents the message that the caller wants to leave, while the caller_name parameter represents the name of the caller. The function then returns a string that simulates the message that an answering machine would play, including the caller's name and the message they want to leave.

Here's an example of how you could use this function:
>>> message = "I'm calling to follow up on my job application."
>>> caller_name = "John"
>>> answering_machine(message, caller_name)
"Hi, this is John. I'm calling to follow up on my job application. Please leave a message after the beep."
